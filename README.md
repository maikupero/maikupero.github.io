# maikupero.github.io

A simple github pages setup to showcase all the web apps I have created. 

If you're interested in building your own github pages site, I found this page to be very helpful:

Built several of the webapps following some of Florinpop's great streams.
I generally like learning by example from people who are naturally using what they already know,
as opposed to trying to follow materials that design stuff specifically to guide my learning in certain ways.
There is absolutely a place for that in education - however since learning Japanese, I've figured out the way that works for me.
