# maikupero.github.io

A simple github pages setup to showcase all the web apps I have created. 

If you're interested in building your own github pages site, I found just about nothing I googled to be helpful. 

Until I talked to [Seth Clydesdale](https://github.com/SethClydesdale) who kindly enlightened me.



Biggest resources for building this github pages site and the various webapps were probably:
- Tyler Potts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBBGM84ZOs7z5jpTQAaZ_Hg
- Florinpop: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA
